`rovr`'s user interface is composed of several panels. You can navigate between them using the keyboard.

### Panels

The main panels are:

- **Pinned Folder Sidebar:** A list of your favorite or frequently accessed folders. (Focus with `s`)
- **File List:** The main panel, showing the files and folders in the current directory.
- **Preview Sidebar:** Shows a preview of the selected file or folder. (Focus with `i`)
- **Footer:** Contains three smaller panels:
  - **Processes List:** Shows ongoing processes like copying or deleting files. (Focus with `f6`)
  - **Metadata List:** Displays metadata for the selected item. (Focus with `m`)
  - **Clipboard List:** Shows items that you have copied or cut. (Focus with `c`)

To return focus to the main file list from any other panel, press `esc`.
