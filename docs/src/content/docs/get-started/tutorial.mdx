### panel navigation

rovr, or textual, supports navigation by tabbing, with cycles the widgets that are on the ui. while you can choose to only use `tab`/`shift+tab` to go between widgets, it is recommended to learn the keystrokes for each action.

rovr displays 8 panels, of which 6 can be focused.

- pinned folder sidebar: `s`
- preview sidebar: `i`
- processes list: `f6` (suggest me a better keybind please!)
- metadata list: `m`
- clipboard list: `c`

to go back to the main file list, you can press the same keybind, or press `esc`.

### panel visibility

rovr supports toggling visibility of 3 panels.
- pinned folder sidebar: `S` or `shift+s`
- preview sidebar: `I` or `shift+i`
- footer (processes + metadata + clipboard): `F` or `shift+f`

### panel traversal
rovr uses a background-highlighted option to show your currently selected option, and switches to a different colored text when unfocused.
#### travelling in lists
- move cursor right/select option: `l` or `right` arrow key
- move cursor left: `h` or `left` arrow key
- move cursor up: `k` or `up`
- move cursor down: `j` or `down`
- go to the first item: `g` or `home`
- go to the last item: `G` or `end`
#### unique to the main file list
- go up the file tree: `h` or `left` arrow key
- go down the file tree: `l`, `right` arrow key, or `enter`
- go back in history: `backspace` or `u`
- go forwards in history: `space`
- pin the currently focused folder: `P` or `shift+p`
- reload file list: `ctrl+r`

#### visual mode
the main file list is the only list that can switch between a multi-selection mode and a single selection mode.
- toggle visual mode: `v`
- select up: `shift+up`, `K` or `shift+k`
- select down: `shift+down` or `J` or `shift+j`
- select page up: `shift+pageup`
- select page down: `shift+pagedown`
- select home: `shift+home`
- select end: `shift+end`

### actions
rovr supports most of the actions that a file explorer should have.
- copy to clipboard: `y` or `ctrl+c`
- cut to clipboard: `x` or `ctrl+x`
- paste from clipboard: `p` or `ctrl+v`
- rename item: `r` or `f2`
- create new item: `o` or `ctrl+n`
- create new compressed file: `E` or `shift+e`
- unzip a compressed file: `ctrl+e`

### multi file view
rovr supports tabs to handle multiple file lists, and does not have a hard capped limit.
- create a new tab: `n`
- close the current tab: `w`
- go to the next tab: `ctrl+j`
- go to the previous tab: `ctrl+k`

### hotkeys
a full list of the hotkeys is available in the [default config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NSPC911/rovr/refs/heads/master/src/rovr/config/config.toml), but here is a visual list of the hotkeys
