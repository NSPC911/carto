import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

rovr makes use of the [`textual-image`](https://github.com/lnqs/textual-image) package to show images.
<br/>this means that it supports the most common types of image previewing.

| Terminal            | TGP support | Sixel support |

| Windows Console     |          ❌ |            ❌ |
| Windows Terminal    |          ❌ |            ✅ |
| xterm               |          ❌ |            ✅ |

however, the `item2 inline images` protocol is not supported. [lnqs/textual-image #68](https://github.com/lnqs/textual-image/issues/68) is a relevant issue to this, but for now, you have to use either the default half-block or use a sixel/tgp supported terminal.

if you are using a terminal that doesn't support such a protocol, textual-image defaults to `half-cell`.

if for any reason, an image doesn't show up, you can overwrite the default image protocol to the image protocol that you think should work on your current terminal.

<Code code={`[settings]\nimage_protocol = "Sixel"`} lang="toml" title="config.toml" />
