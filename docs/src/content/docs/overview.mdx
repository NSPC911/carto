let's use the [5w1h framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws) to describe rovr

### what is rovr?

a modern answer to a terminal file explorer, that can be customized to fit your workflow easily, while being aesthetically pleasing

### why should I use rovr?

I can't answer this question, but I can answer why you _shouldn't_ use rovr.
<br/>you shouldnt use rovr if

1. you have an existing workflow with any other file explorers (superfile excluded)
   other file managers like [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi), [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) or [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn) are amazing file explorers, and rovr cannot compete with their flexibility or extensibility.

2. when you are allergic to non-compiled apps
   rovr is made in python, and uses some features that prevents it from being compiled by [pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller) or [nuitka](https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka). if you are someone who is allergic to such an app, please step away now.

### why did I make it?

I had quite some issues with [superfile](https://github.com/yorukot/superfile). it is an amazing project, and you should definitely go check it out.

<br />
however, some issues I had was with its performance. spf does not utilise either
threads nor asyncio, everything runs on a single app process, which can lead to
plenty of lag when travelling.
<br />I wouldve loved to fix these issues, but I dont have any golang
background, and I found [textual](https://github.com/Textualize/Textual) as a
framework, and really wanted to put my skills to the test.
<br />
so I guess we are here now.
