description: How to configure rovr

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

rovr's configuration is held in a single location. you can find it by running
```sh
rovr --config-path
```

inside it, you can see 3 files if you previously launched rovr

<FileTree>

- rovr
  - config.toml
  - styles.tcss
  - pins.json

</FileTree>


### config.toml
the config is handled in a simple config file.

it also has a schema available, so if you use either [`tombi`](https://github.com/tombi-toml/tombi) or [`taplo`](https://github.com/tamasfe/taplo) to see an autocompletion popup.

for the full schema, please refer to the [`JSON Schema for Humans`](/schema) page

### styles.tcss
styling in textual is handled by `tcss` files, a simplified version of the web's `css`. A reference is available in the [textual docs](https://textual.textualize.io/styles/)

rovr comes with some variables pre-initialised, that you can overwrite.

```scss
/* border when a container isn't focused */
$border-blurred: $primary-darken-3;
/* border when a container is currently focused */
$border: $primary-lighten-3;
/* border style (https://textual.textualize.io/css_types/border) */
$border-style: round;

/* reference: https://textual.textualize.io/css_types/scalar */
/* pinned folder sidebar width */
$pinned_sidebar_width: 20;
/* the main file list width */
$file_list_width: 1fr;
/* the preview sidebar width */
$preview_sidebar_width: 35vw;
/* the footer when nothing inside it is focused */
$footer_unfocus_height: 8;
/* the footer when something inside it is focused */
$footer_focus_height: 10;
```

For more advanced styling, refer to [`configuration/themeing`](/configuration/themeing)

### pins.json
this file doesn't have a schema, mainly because it is pretty simple

the file follows a schema as such
```json
{
  "default": [
    ...
    {
      "name": "<label>",
      "path": "<path>"
    }
  ],
  "pins": [
    ...
    {
      "name": "<label>",
      "path": "<path>"
    }
  ]
}
```
the path supports variables to a fixed path
```scss
$DOCUMENTS: /* user documents directory */
$DOWNLOADS: /* user downloads directory */
$MUSIC:     /* user music directory     */
$PICTURES:  /* user pictures directory  */
$DESKTOP:   /* user desktop directory   */
$HOME:      /* user home directory (~)  */
$VIDEOS:    /* user videos directory    */
$CONFIG:    /* user config directory    */
```
so, you can have a path as `$home/games` and it will expand to `~/games` or `%USERPROFILE%/games` depending on your os
